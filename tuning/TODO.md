# To-Do's

- [x] Refactor the `opt_wrappers` into separate files for each of the algorithms, i.e. `ppo_wrapper.py`, `sakc_wrapper.py`, `skvi_wrapper.py`
    - [x] SKVI
    - [x] SAKC
- [ ] Debug the hyperparameter optimization end-to-end
- [ ] Think of what a larger refactoring could look like, especially with an eye towards the separate Koopman-RL package within the dynamicslab organization
